I'll come straight to the point: there are only a few things that you can do that will massively impact your chances of being successful.

## Step 1: Improving Focus
Extreme Self-Discipline: First, you need to bring extreme self-discipline into all parts of your life. In a way, you'll have to boost your morale in every part of life. This is important because we often feel that for our special projects, like a startup or a book, we can increase our focus. But actually, how you live your hours is how you live your day, and how you live your day is how you live your life. So, if your self-discipline outside this project is less then the self-discipline in your life will be less, and you won't be able to put extreme focus on your special project.
