there are some days when you're unsure of what you should do, or about to do, you kind of feel lost, but then you stumble upon something, maybe a youtube video that shifts your entire perspective.

you start thinking about things that you might not have thought about and suddenly things start making sense because you started seeing things differently!

i guess this is why it's really important that you don't mindlessly consume any content, you can read biographies, watch biopics, etc but then you have to be mindful!

recently, i got this youtube video recommended on my feed about dosas, and when i watched the entire video, i got to know about how this family runs a dosa stall once a week in new york, before setting up their stall, they prepare everything at homeâ€”like the aloo masala and sambhar, which need to be ready in advance! then, they set up a tent, start making the dosas, and sell them! i got to know about their entire journey of how they got started and the community they are building!

i think what i'm saying is watching that youtube video got me thinking, that there are so many things that you can do in life, not just what you're doing and that there are so many stories happening at this exact moment in time, that reminds of endless possibilities!
